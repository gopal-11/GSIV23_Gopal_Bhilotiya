a. Instructions about how to run and test your code.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

b. List elements from the challenge that you think you have done well, and
that exemplify your proficiency. Please describe why you chose those:elements, and how they demonstrate your proficiency.

1. I have used the redux saga for managing the application data which is one time configuration but helps to manage the data in fast and easy way.

2. I have made the application responsive so the data can be viewed in any of the devices easily and in well organized way.

3. I have created the folder structures for different components separataly so that in future if I need to modify any component then I can easily modify them.

c. List what you would do to improve your solution if you had 4 more hours
available for this task. Describe why you would do those things.

1. I will focuse on on css to get better UI view.

2. I will implement loader on the infinite scroll feature.

3. I will implement catch in the redux to handle the request failure.

d. Optional: Any feedback about how we may improve this challenge.

1. It would be better to provide the api endpoints in the task pdf doc. I find difficulty in find some of the data as mentioned like cast, actors, director, in the movie detail api mentioned below so I kept them as static only.
   `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/${data.id}?api_key=${API_KEY}`

2. The UI sketch would be better if provided with the better ui in terms of colors
